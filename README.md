# TODO App - PESTO Take Home Assessment
_Sharukh Rahman S_ -> [Portfolio](https://sharukhrahman.vercel.app/)

The application will allow users to create, update, and delete tasks. Tasks should have a title, description, and a status (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). Users should also be able to view a list of tasks and filter them by status.
